This github repository hosts the template structure I use for various
projects. It includes a general file structure for organized workflow,
my manuscript templates for
[LaTeX](assets/templates/Manuscript_Template.tex), [MS
Word](assets/templates/Manuscript_Template.docx), and
[HTML](assets/css/lux-modified.scss), along with [example
files](manuscript/) corresponding to each. Finally, it includes my
BibLaTeX references file containing almost 1,500 citations from
political science and applied statistics.

To download the current version of this project skeleton, you can
execute the following command from a desktop terminal

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/ajnafa/project-template.git
